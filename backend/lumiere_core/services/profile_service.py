Generate a "Developer Profile Briefing" in Markdown with these exact sections:

### 1. Identity & Technical Focus
*   Based on their bio, owned repos, and starred repos, what are '{username}'s primary technical interests?
*   What are their main programming languages? (e.g., JavaScript, C++, Python)

### 2. Community Engagement Style
*   Based on their comments, what is '{username}'s role in the community? Are they reporting bugs, asking for help, or providing solutions?
*   Analyze the tone and content of THEIR comments. For example: `The user provides detailed debugging reports ("Debugging Report: itzzzme/anime-api Integration Issues") suggesting a methodical approach to problem-solving.`

### 3. Community Reception
*   Look at the replies to '{username}'s comments. Are others engaging with them? Are they receiving help and feedback?
*   Briefly summarize the nature of the replies they receive (e.g., "The user receives helpful replies from other developers, who offer suggestions and updated decryption keys.").
